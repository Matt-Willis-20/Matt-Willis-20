### Hi, I'm Matt :wave: 

I'm a frontend web developer, currently living in Luton, UK.  

I love to solve problems, create modern, user-centric web pages and apps, and I have a relentless drive to be the best programmer I can!

Having worked in both the private and public sectors, I have a wealth of experience which I can leverage as a programmer: communication, teamwork, project management, process improvement, relationship-building, stakeholder management, and leadership. 

If you would like to discuss job opportinuties, a new collaboration, my projects, or simply say hi and build your network, please reach out.

### RECENT PROJECTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS


<br>:fire:**FINSWEET - A REACT APP**

![finsweet](finsweet1.png)


My first solo React Project! 

I've absolutely loved building _Finsweet_, taking a Figma design file and bringing it to life.  It is an evolving piece of work and with the guidance of a fantastic mentor, I continue to explore new functionality and expand the scope of the project.

<br><br>:fire:**JUUBIX GAME DEVELOPMENT**

<img src="#" alt="Juubix Logo" style="width: 200px">
A great example of how I have been able to use my transferable skills to refine the development of the company's gamification aspirations.


<br>:fire:**MY ELEC CHECK**

_An app to help keep monitor your electricity use in a time of ever-increasing living-costs_

This new project, currently in development, showcases my JavaScript knowledge.  Working on My ELEC CHECK has given me the opportunity to work through a full development cylce, from conceptualisation to final product.  I've proactively found a mentor to help guide me on the project, but has also provided the opportunutiy to collaboarate, experience code reviews and use fedback to improve my programming.

<br>I have strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  With the growing number of projects that I have worked on, I have made a conscious effort to use and implement related libraries and framworks, such as Sass, Bootstrap, Material UI and React.

</div>  

<br>I'm aware of the need for continuous, life-long learning, and with that, acknowledge that I will need to continue developing a deeper understadning of JavaScript as I progress into a technical role. Along side this, I am building new projects to deepen my knowledge of React.  Althouhg my current focus is on FrontEnd Development, I want to progress with Node.js, mainly through a TDD approach.  With a love of design, I also want to become more familiar with Figma so that I am equipt to support the conceptualisation of future projects.
